# Cricket Game Simulation

This repository contains a Python script that simulates an interactive cricket game between a user team and a computer team.

The game includes features such as a toss to decide which team bats or bowls first, user input for team names and overs selection, and a dynamic gameplay experience where users press a key to deliver each ball.

# Features

- Team Naming: Input to name your team, with the computer team named "Computer".
- Overs Selection: Choose the number of overs (2 or 5) for the match.
- Toss Decision: Simulates a toss to decide which team bats or bowls first. If the user wins the toss, they can choose to bat or bowl. If the computer wins, it randomly decides.
- Interactive Gameplay: Press a key to deliver each ball and see the outcome (runs or wicket).
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of total runs, wickets, and balls played for both teams.
- Target Chasing: The game stops automatically if the chasing team reaches the target score.
- Result Declaration: Declares the winner or if the match is a tie.
